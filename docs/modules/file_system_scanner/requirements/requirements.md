# File System Scanner Requirements

## Overview
The File System Scanner module is responsible for traversing the file system, collecting file metadata, and applying exclusion rules. It provides the foundation for all file analysis operations in the disk cleaner.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Directory Traversal
- **Recursive Scanning**: Traverse directory trees with configurable depth limits
- **Path Handling**: Support Windows paths, UNC paths, and relative paths
- **Symlink Handling**: Configurable symlink following with loop detection
- **Permission Handling**: Graceful handling of access-denied directories
- **Large Directory Optimization**: Efficient handling of directories with many files

### 2. File Metadata Collection
- **Basic Metadata**: File path, size, modification time, creation time
- **Extended Metadata**: File attributes, owner information (if available)
- **Hash Preparation**: Collect data needed for duplicate detection
- **Performance Metadata**: Track scanning performance metrics

### 3. Exclusion and Filtering
- **Pattern Matching**: Support glob patterns for file/directory exclusion
- **Size Filtering**: Skip files below minimum size threshold
- **Type Filtering**: Filter by file extensions or MIME types
- **Path-based Exclusion**: Exclude specific directories or path patterns
- **System File Handling**: Special handling for Windows system files

### 4. Progress Tracking
- **Real-time Progress**: Provide progress updates during scanning
- **Estimates**: Calculate estimated completion time
- **Cancellation Support**: Allow graceful cancellation of scanning operations
- **Resume Capability**: Support resuming interrupted scans

### 5. Resource Management
- **Memory Efficiency**: Process files in batches to manage memory usage
- **CPU Optimization**: Balance scanning speed with system responsiveness
- **I/O Optimization**: Efficient file system access patterns
- **Thread Safety**: Ensure thread-safe operations for parallel processing

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- **Scanning Speed**: Minimum 10,000 files per second on SSD
- **Memory Usage**: < 100MB for typical scanning operations
- **CPU Usage**: Configurable CPU utilization limits
- **Scalability**: Handle file systems with millions of files

### Reliability
- **Error Recovery**: Continue scanning after individual file errors
- **Data Integrity**: Ensure collected metadata is accurate
- **Resource Cleanup**: Proper cleanup of system resources
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging of scanning operations

### Usability
- **Configuration**: Easy configuration of scan parameters
- **Monitoring**: Real-time visibility into scanning progress
- **Diagnostics**: Detailed error reporting and diagnostics

## Interface Requirements

### Input Interfaces
- **Configuration**: ScanConfig object with paths, exclusions, limits
- **Callbacks**: Progress callback functions for UI updates
- **Cancellation Token**: Mechanism to cancel ongoing operations

### Output Interfaces
- **File Iterator**: Iterator yielding FileInfo objects
- **Progress Stream**: Stream of progress update events
- **Summary Statistics**: Scan summary with counts, sizes, timing

## Dependencies
- **External**: pathlib, os, fnmatch, psutil
- **Internal**: Configuration Manager (for scan settings)

## Testing Requirements
- **Mock File Systems**: Test with various directory structures
- **Permission Scenarios**: Test access denied, read-only files
- **Large File Sets**: Test performance with many files
- **Edge Cases**: Empty directories, symlinks, special files
